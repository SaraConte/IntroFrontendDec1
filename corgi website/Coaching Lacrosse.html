<p><h2 style="font-family: 'Istok Web', sans-serif;">Coaching a new sport can be overwhelming.</h2> As lacrosse explodes into new geographic areas and permeates the youth sports scene, the demand for qualified coaches will continue to grow. Even if you're new to the game, you might be asked to step in and help out. While you might not be an expert on the X's and O's right away, there are universal coaching principles that can empower you to succeed in this role.</p>

<blockquote>"Coaching lacrosse is fun,"shouted Coach Sara from the sidelines.</blockquote>
<p>We've partnered with Dr. Richard Ginsburg, a noted sports psychologist and member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School, to present the "Top 10 Tips for Coaching Youth." Ginsburg, who also serves as a member of US Lacrosse's Sports, Science and Safety Committee, challenges coaches to examine what they love about the game and to consider what inspires them to coach. He also encourages coaches to reframe their definition of success-with outcomes ranging from winning to having fun, from skill improvement to learning sportsmanship.</p>

<p>Using age-appropriate methods and understanding the developmental differences in youth of various ages and gender will help you, the new (or experienced) lacrosse coach, prevent injury and promote positive cognitive and motor development.</p>


<p>Here are Dr. Ginsburg's <b>10 tips for coaching youth lacrosse players</b>, and youth athletes in general. For more on each of these principles, check back as we discuss one per day for the next two weeks.</p>
